# CS 245 (Spring, 2019) Practice Assignment 05 (Read my comment below first)

The MergeSort Code works, but I had trouble compiling after cloning it onto my own computer.

I realized this after I uploaded the graph so I didn't want to reupload the file

To fix this, I copied the code, then deleted the file, then made a new one and then pasted the code into the new file. It now then works. I don't what what caused this, but this fixes it.
